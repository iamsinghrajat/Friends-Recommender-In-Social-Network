Link Prediction in Social Netowork
=================================

Uses Networkx library for graph representation and score calculation

How To Use
----------
#. 


    .. code-block:: shell

        pip install networkx
         
#.
 
    To run and understand this code  first reach ___EntryPoint___ (You can search for it in python code)

 
#.

    * facebook_combine.txt is dataset.

    * Facebook dataset is included download others from http://snap.stanford.edu/data/ Use one with format like twitter_combine.txt or gplus_combine.txt .
    
    * At entry point you can choose which dataset to use you can even add your own dataset from http://snap.stanford.edu/data/ . Code will work for all dataset.
 
#.

    Name of dataset you want to run this code for, and cn is a integer for that dataset(any integer will work but different for each dataset)

    By default it is set to Facebook Data Set

    The project was run using Facebook and Twitter dataset but it works with any social network dataset from http://snap.stanford.edu/data/
    

#.
    Following Scoring Methods are used to construct feature Set


    * common_neighbors

    * resource_allocation_index

    * jaccard_coefficient

    * adamic_adar_index

    * preferential_attachment


#.
    SVM ANN and Logistic Regresssion is used for classificaion
